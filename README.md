## Background/About

### This project tasked our 3 person team to build a full-stack application in 10 days. We set-up a Postgres database and used Knex to create our tables, migrate, and seed our data into multiple environments: development, production, CI, and testing.  Our team enjoyed developing our understanding of the request/response cycle, backend testing, and what goes into building out a robust back-end.  
### For the front-end we chose to work with Material-UI, despite it not being in the project spec, as a way of challenging ourselves to work with some form of new technology.  Pre-styled components come with their own challenges, but maintaining a healthy interest in using new technology is an important skill to have at one's fingertips.
### This project also saw us implementing co-authored commits in our pull requests when we were coding as a group.  When separated, we were diligent abouut keeping each other abreast of changes made through PRs on Github and rebasing our local code.
